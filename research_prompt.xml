            <Part1>
                Provide a conceptual or mathematical representation of the topic, including equations or pseudo-equations if relevant.
                Include a complete English reading of the equation after the "where" statements, explaining the function fully in words.
            </Part1>
            <Part2>
                Provide an ASCII illustration or step-by-step text diagram explaining the concept.
            </Part2>
            <Part3>
                Provide a short XML snippet suitable for a "like I'm 5" explanation, using simple language and nested tags.
            </Part3>
            <RequestFormat>
                Ensure each part is labeled or separated by clear headers (e.g., "1) Math", "2) ASCII", "3) XML").
                Use LaTeX or inline math notation where appropriate.
                Keep the XML section short, child-friendly, and nested in a straightforward way.
